# Getting Ready

Hi everybody and thanks for attending the workshop! 
In order to follow along with the program you will have to first follow the instructions in this file before attending, so that you have everything set up and ready.
If you have any issues with the installation, please feel free to come some minutes before the workshop so we can try and find a solution.

## VM

A virtual machine (VM) can be considered as a computer running INSIDE your computer. 
To do this we need a VM manager, there are several around but the one that will have the most documentation and tutorials around is probably VirtualBox.

Both Windows and MacOS users can download the VM manager from:

-   <https://www.virtualbox.org/>

and follow <span class="underline">this tutorial</span> for installation:

or any other for virtualbox

## ISO

After installing VirtualBox you need to download a Linux distro ISO. The .iso file is the installation file that you would usually find on a CD (remember those times? :') ).
To follow along just download one of the following ISOs

-   [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?country=NL&version=18.04.1&architecture=amd64)
-   [Lubuntu](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/18.04/release/lubuntu-18.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso) (More lightweight, 2gb of RAM and 1 core are enough.)

Now that you have your .iso file you can use it in virtualbox to start your linux instance inside Windows.
If you followed the previous video tutorial all the way through you already know how to do this.
Otherwise here is the link to the video again:

## About free software

We will also talk about free software, especially in research. If you want a sneak peak before the workshop, go watch Richard Stallman's TedTalk on free software.
